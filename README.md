# Can you guess if the text is real?

Using datasets from GPT-2 to display randomized text between Webtext and generated texts.

## Eventually
- Choose a difficulty and guess which text was written by a human and which was made by a computer.
- Have points for the number of correct guesses in a row
- Leaderboard

But for now just enjoy what's there :)
